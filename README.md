# A Simple React App Built for My Daughter

This small project served as my first dive into the React framework as well to build something for my daughter who loves everything police and crime.

The app is very simple, take in name and state/prison code parameters and make a GET request to the JailBase API to retrieve prisoner records and details.
While the app is small and simple I was able to learn the basics of getting a React app up and running, function components, hooks, and passing data between components.

The app is deployed on DigitalOcean at https://perp-finder-n5y8c.ondigitalocean.app/
